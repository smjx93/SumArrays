/*
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. 
The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any 
numbers then you should return 0.

*/

function sum(numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  }

/*
This function takes an array arr as an argument and returns the sum of the numbers in the array.
It does this using the reduce method, which applies a function to each element of the array in turn,
accumulating a single result. In this case, the function takes two arguments: sum and num. 

sum is the current accumulated value, and num is the current element being processed. 

The function adds num to sum and returns the result. 

The second argument to reduce is the 
initial value of sum, which in this case is 0. If the array is empty, reduce returns the 
initial value (0) without calling the function.
